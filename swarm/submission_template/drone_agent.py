class DroneFlightController:
    """
    Swarm Subnet 124 — Autonomous Drone Flight Controller (V5 Search-and-Rescue)

    Implement your navigation policy in this class. The controller receives
    observations from a simulated drone and must output flight commands to
    locate a humanoid victim on the ground and hover over it.

    Observation Space:
        Dictionary with three keys:
        - "depth": numpy array (256, 256, 1) — normalized depth map [0,1] for the
          0.5-30m range. Use this to find the victim with vision.
        - "rgb": numpy array (256, 256, 3) — colour frame in [0,1], on demand. All
          zeros unless your previous action requested it (see Action Space); you may
          request up to 40 colour frames per episode.
        - "state": numpy array (N,) — flight state vector. Index ranges:
            [0:3]   drone position (x, y, z) in meters
            [3:6]   orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)
            [6:9]   linear velocities (vx, vy, vz) m/s
            [9:12]  angular velocities (wx, wy, wz) rad/s
            [12:12+A] action history (A = ACTION_BUFFER_SIZE × action_dim)
            [12+A]  altitude (normalized)
            [12+A+1:12+A+3] search-clue offset (Δx, Δy) — 2D, victim XY is
              somewhere within a 30 m circle around this clue. No Z component.

    Mission (V5 Search-and-Rescue):
        - You receive a noisy 2D coordinate inside a 30 m circle around the
          victim's true XY. There is no Z in the clue.
        - Travel to the area, use depth to find the victim, then hover 2-4 m
          above the victim's AABB top, within 2 m horizontal distance, at less
          than 1.0 m/s speed, for 2 continuous seconds.
        - The victim has a 0.8 m no-touch sphere — entering it ends the
          episode as a terminal failure.

    Action Space:
        numpy array (6,) containing [dir_x, dir_y, dir_z, speed, yaw, rgb_request]
        - dir_x, dir_y, dir_z: direction components, range [-1, 1]
        - speed: thrust multiplier, range [0, 1]
        - yaw: target yaw normalized, range [-1, 1] maps to [-π, π]
        - rgb_request: range [0, 1]. Set above 0.5 to ask for a colour frame in the
          next observation's "rgb" key (max 40 per episode; ignored beyond that).

    Scoring:
        score = 0.45 × success + 0.45 × time + 0.10 × safety
        Successful CONFIRMED returns the full scoring stack.
        Legitimate non-success failures (collision, no-touch-sphere,
        infeasible, spawn-failure, tilt, timeout) return 0.01 participation.

    Constraints:
        - Max velocity: 3.0 m/s (enforced by validator)
        - Max yaw rate: 3.141 rad/s (180°/s)
        - Simulation rate: 30 Hz control / 30 Hz physics
