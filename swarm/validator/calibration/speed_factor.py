"""Reference-time normalization for hardware-fair scoring.

Each validator measures itself against a single fixed baseline model and converts
every miner ``act()`` time into baseline-equivalent time, so the score does not
depend on how fast the validator's host is.

    speed_factor = local_p90 / owner_p90

The factor is a property of the host, not of any task. It is measured once per
worker on the committed baseline model and then applied to every miner across all
challenge families. The baseline model's family and challenge type only describe
how the timing workload is run; they do not scope where the factor is used.
