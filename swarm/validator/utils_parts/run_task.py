"""Single-task worker for the validator.

The ``forward`` loop hands one task at a time to ``run_task``. The
function downloads the model, runs the requested phase, and submits
the result. Cancellation flows through ``cancel_flag`` (set by the SSE
listener); the streaming evaluator checks it at chunk boundaries.

Backend recomputes the authoritative score from ``SeedScore`` rows, so
the ``score`` we submit is a sanity-check averaged from the seeds the
validator just ran. Per-type scores are likewise local; backend
recomputes per-type means by aggregating across the relevant tasks.
