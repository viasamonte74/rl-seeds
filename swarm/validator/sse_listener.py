"""SSE listener that turns backend state-change events into local flags.

Runs as a supervised background task off ``forward.py``. The forward
loop reads ``cancel_flag`` between chunks to abort in-flight work and
``wake_flag`` to short-circuit its idle sleep so it polls /next-task
again as soon as a state change happens.

Reconnect is automatic with exponential backoff. ``Last-Event-ID`` is
re-sent on each reconnect so the backend can replay missed events
within its ring buffer (or emit ``resync_required`` if it cannot).
``BackendProtocolMismatchError`` propagates so the supervisor can fail
the validator loudly instead of silently downgrading.
