# 🔐 Swarm Validator Guide

This document shows how to install and operate the Swarm validator. The validator securely evaluates miner models across five challenge families on procedurally generated maps: cities, open terrain, mountains, villages, warehouses, and forests. Miner models run in isolated Docker containers under the subnet-owned runner, while evaluation and scoring execute on the validator host.

Run `swarm doctor` after installation to verify your environment is ready.

## 🎯 What You Evaluate

Swarm runs **five challenge families**, all active. Evaluation is family-scoped: every task the backend hands you names one family, and the validator builds that family's environment, maps, and seeds from the task metadata; you never pick a family yourself.

| Family | ID | Mission | Emissions |
|--------|-----|---------|-----------|
| [Autopilot](families/autopilot.md) | `cf_autopilot` | One drone crosses a generated world and lands on a pad inside a noisy search area | 15% |
| [Search and Rescue](families/search_and_rescue.md) | `cf_search_and_rescue` | One drone finds a downed victim by depth camera and holds a confirmation hover overhead | 15% |
| [Swarm Autopilot](families/swarm_autopilot.md) | `cf_swarm_autopilot` | One policy lands 2–8 drones on a shared pool of pads | 20% |
| [Swarm Search and Rescue](families/swarm_sar.md) | `cf_swarm_sar` | One policy sweeps the map with 2–8 drones until any drone confirms the victim | 20% |
| [Interceptor](families/interceptor.md) | `cf_interceptor` | One drone hunts down and rams a validator-flown target over open terrain | 30% |

## 🖥️ System Requirements

| Resource | Minimal | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| CPU | 12 cores | |
| RAM | 48 GB | |
| Disk | 50 GB | Environment + model cache |
| GPU | None | |

**Supported Linux distros:**

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble)

Other distros should work; install equivalent packages manually.

## 🐳 Docker Installation (Required)

**Docker is mandatory** for validator operation. The validator cannot start without Docker.

### Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04

```bash
# 1. Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 2. Install Docker dependencies
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# 3. Add Docker official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# 4. Add Docker repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# 5. Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# 6. Start and enable Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Recommended hardening

Run the validator under its own user instead of your login account:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash swarm-validator
sudo usermod -aG docker swarm-validator
```

Keep evaluation containers isolated from each other by setting `"icc": false`
in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```bash
echo '{ "icc": false }' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

For an extra layer you can run [rootless Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).

### Verify Docker

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
docker ps
sudo systemctl status docker
```

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

## ⚙️ Run the Validator

### PM2 Launch

```bash
source validator_env/bin/activate

pm2 start neurons/validator.py --name swarm_validator -- \
  --netuid 124 \
  --subtensor.network finney \
  --wallet.name my_cold \
  --wallet.hotkey my_validator \
  --logging.debug
```

### Logs

```bash
pm2 logs swarm_validator
```

### Stop / Restart

```bash
pm2 restart swarm_validator
pm2 stop    swarm_validator
```

## 📡 Telemetry and Monitor

The validator now writes a local runtime snapshot and an append-only event stream while it runs.

### Files

By default, telemetry is written here:

```bash
swarm/state/validator_runtime.json
swarm/state/validator_events.jsonl
```

- `validator_runtime.json`
  - Current point-in-time health snapshot.
  - Best source for dashboards and alert state.
- `validator_events.jsonl`
  - Structured event log.
  - Useful for reconstructing stage transitions and debugging stalls.

### Monitor Command

Run the live terminal monitor:

```bash
source validator_env/bin/activate
swarm monitor
```

Useful variants:

```bash
swarm monitor --once --no-clear
swarm monitor --refresh-sec 2.0
swarm monitor --max-events 20
```

### What the Monitor Shows

- **Forward**
  - Last forward start/completion, duration, and whether a cycle is still running.
- **Backend**
  - Sync state, fallback mode, pending model count, re-eval queue size, leaderboard version.
- **Epoch**
  - Current epoch, seconds until epoch end, and whether freeze mode is active.
- **Queue**
  - Local queue counts by status, oldest item age, retry pressure, and the active queue items.
- **Evaluation**
  - Current screening and benchmark progress.
- **Docker**
  - Requested/effective workers, adaptive backoff, worker failures/restarts, cleanup timing.
- **Chain / Weights**
  - Post-forward chain sync state and the latest weight-set attempt/result.
- **Alerts**
  - Automatic warning/critical classification for common stalls and dead zones.

### What to Expect in Healthy Operation

- `pending_models_count` rises and falls, but does not grow forever.
- Queue items move through:
  - `processing`
  - `registered`
  - `screening`
  - `screening_submit`
  - `benchmark`
  - `score_submit`
  - `completed`

  The `screening` and `screening_submit` stages run only when the backend enables the screening phase, which is off by default, so new models go straight to `benchmark`.
- `last_completed_forward_count` keeps increasing.
- `backend.fallback` stays `false` most of the time.
- Docker `active_worker_cap` usually matches the requested worker count.
- `oldest_age_sec` stays bounded instead of drifting upward for hours.

### Common Warning Signs

- **Backend fallback stays active**
  - New `pending_models` discovery is effectively stalled.
- **Queue oldest age keeps increasing**
  - Work is arriving faster than it is draining, or a stage is stuck.
- **Retries dominate the queue**
  - Backend submission failures or internal exceptions are recycling items.
- **Freeze active with processable queue items**
  - The validator is intentionally pausing queue work near epoch end.
- **Docker backoff active for long periods**
  - The host is overloaded or worker execution is unhealthy.
- **Repeated re-eval warnings**
  - Champion or queued re-evals are being recomputed repeatedly instead of finishing cleanly.
- **No forward completion**
  - The validator thread, backend sync, Docker cleanup, or post-forward chain sync may be stalled.

### Recommended First Checks

If the monitor looks unhealthy:

1. Confirm Docker is healthy:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker stats --no-stream
   ```
2. Check whether backend sync is falling back:
   - look for `backend.fallback=true`
   - look at `last_sync_success_at`
3. Check whether queue items are stuck in one stage:
   - especially `screening`, `benchmark`, or `score_submit`
4. Check whether adaptive backoff reduced worker capacity:
   - compare `requested_workers` vs `active_worker_cap`
5. Check whether epoch freeze is active:
   - the queue may be waiting by design near epoch rollover

### Notes

- The monitor is local-only and reads the validator's own telemetry files.
- If the validator is not running yet, the telemetry files may not exist.
- The event log is append-only; if it grows too much, rotate or truncate it during maintenance windows.

## 🔄 Auto-Update

**`scripts/validator/update/auto_update_deploy.sh`** checks `origin/main` for version bumps every *n* minutes. When a new version is found, it pulls, resets, and restarts the PM2 process.

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/validator/update/auto_update_deploy.sh
chmod +x ./scripts/validator/update/update_deploy.sh

# Edit variables at the top of auto_update_deploy.sh
nano ./scripts/validator/update/auto_update_deploy.sh

# Run under PM2
pm2 start --name auto_update_validator \
          --interpreter /bin/bash \
          scripts/validator/update/auto_update_deploy.sh
```

## 🧩 What the Validator Does

1. **Sync with the backend**
   `GET /validators/sync` returns the current epoch, the per-family King of the Hill windows and family shares, the champions, and the latest weight map. Runs once per forward cycle. Evaluation work arrives separately via the `GET /validators/next-task` long-poll, which assigns the model under evaluation; individual seeds are then leased on demand through `POST /validators/tasks/{id}/claim-seeds` as workers free up.

2. **Fetch the model**
   Download `submission.zip` from the miner's GitHub repo and verify the SHA-256 hash against the backend record (the README hash is checked at submission time by the backend).

3. **Full benchmark (1,100 seeds)**
   Every new model runs its family's full 1,100-seed benchmark in parallel Docker containers. Seeds are leased one at a time: whenever a worker frees, the validator claims the next pending seed from the backend's shared pool, so validators of different speeds share one model with no idle tails. The task metadata carries the family and phase, so no local configuration is needed. A screening pre-phase (the first 300 seeds, with a pass bar tied to the champion's score) exists behind a backend constant but is off by default: submissions go straight to the full benchmark.

4. **Report scores**
   Per-seed and aggregate scores are submitted to the backend as they are computed.

5. **Apply weights**
   Validators recompute the weight map locally from the per-family windows on every forward cycle and set it on-chain on the chain's epoch-length cadence. The weights come from per-family King of the Hill windows: each family's last five champions share that family's emission slice; see [king_of_the_hill.md](king_of_the_hill.md).

6. **Caching**
   Results are cached by model hash + benchmark version + epoch. The same model is not re-evaluated within the same epoch unless a re-eval is explicitly queued (for example, a benchmark version bump).

### Per-Validator Seeds

Each validator independently generates its own 1,100 random seeds per family per epoch using `random.SystemRandom()`. With 1,100 seeds per validator and per-seed results stitched across validators, statistical variance across validators is negligible.

Seeds rotate every **7 days** (Monday 16:00 UTC). At the end of each epoch, per-validator seeds are published on [swarm124.com](https://swarm124.com) for full transparency.
