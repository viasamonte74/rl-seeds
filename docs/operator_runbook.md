# Operator Runbook

Internal guide for the team running the Swarm backend and validators. It covers the knobs that change network behavior: family rollout, the registry copies, validator trust, version gating, the screening switch, and the epoch freeze. Miner- and validator-facing setup lives in [miner.md](miner.md) and [validator.md](validator.md).

---

## Family Rollout Controls

The rollout is hardcoded: every validator on the current contract may evaluate
every registry family. The old `SWARM_ROLLOUT_*` env vars were removed together
with the code-shipping submission format; setting them today has no effect.

### The validator contract

`VALIDATOR_CONTRACT_VERSION = 'agent_rpc.v1'` is the single accepted
contract. The backend pins it in `app/rollout.py`; the validator sends it on
every signed request as `X-Swarm-Validator-Contract`, sourced from
`swarm/core/submission_policy.py` (`VALIDATOR_CONTRACT`), alongside
`X-Validator-Hotkey` / `-Signature` / `-Nonce` / `-Timestamp` and
`X-Code-Version`.

### Compatibility (`get_validator_rollout_compatibility`)

Binary: a validator presenting `agent_rpc.v1` is compatible and may
evaluate all enabled families; anything else gets `upgrade_required=True`,
an empty `safe_family_ids`, and reason `validator_contract_upgrade_required`.

`POST /validators/tasks/authorize` denies any family outside the validator's `safe_family_ids`: `authorized=False`, `reason_code='upgrade_required'` (when upgrade is required) or `'rollout_restricted'`, `requeue_policy='permanent'`.

Two things to know when operating this:

- The full rollout payload (`{mode, default_family_id, enabled_family_ids, required_validator_contract, enforce_validator_contract}`) is attached to task-authorize / next-task responses and to the public `GET /families/metadata` as `payload['rollout']`. Validators persist it (plus their own `validator_compatibility`) into `swarm/state/runtime_state.json`, so you can inspect what a validator last saw.
- The enabled set gates **validator task authorization only**. Miner submission ingestion (chain scanner) validates family existence and visibility against the registry, not the rollout enabled set: `is_rollout_enabled_family` exists in `rollout.py` but has no callers.

## Family Registry: Three Copies, One Source of Truth

The registry that defines the families, their states, policies, and emission allocations lives in three places:

| Repo | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| swarm | `swarm/domain_model/benchmark_domain_model.schema.json` | **Source of truth** (schema_version `2026-05-25`) |
| swarm-backend | `app/family_registry.json` | Byte-identical copy, loaded by `app/domain_model.py` |
| Swarm-Website | `src/family_registry.json` | Byte-identical copy |

**Sync is manual.** After editing the schema in the swarm repo, run:

```bash
python3 swarm/scripts/sync_family_registry.py \
  --backend swarm-backend --website Swarm-Website
```

The script reads the swarm-repo schema and overwrites both copies. Both checkouts must be named: a workspace can hold several worktrees of the same repo on different branches, and a directory name cannot tell them apart, so pointing at the wrong one would write the registry into an unrelated branch. Add `--check` to report drift without writing (non-zero exit when a mirror is stale) — useful before a release. There is no CI hook: the only other automated guard is the backend test `test_registry_copies_are_in_sync_across_code_repos`, and it **skips** when the sibling checkouts are absent, so divergence is only caught when backend tests run in a full three-repo workspace.

Divergence matters: the backend derives `CHALLENGE_FAMILY_IDS`, `FAMILY_STATES`, and `EMISSIONS_STATES` from **its** copy at import time, DB `challenge_family` rows are seeded and repaired from that copy, and the chain scanner rejects any submission naming a family the backend copy doesn't know.

### Current registry state

Five families, all `family_state='active'` and `emissions_state='active'`:

| Family | `emission_allocation` |
|--------|----------------------|
| `cf_interceptor` | 0.30 |
| `cf_swarm_autopilot` | 0.20 |
| `cf_swarm_sar` | 0.20 |
| `cf_autopilot` | 0.15 |
| `cf_search_and_rescue` | 0.15 |

Allocations sum to 1.00: the pool is fully allocated, so nothing burns for being unclaimed. Any burn now comes from a family that is itself not payable — no kings, no crowning for 7 days, or archived. There is no headroom left, so raising one family through `POST /admin/families/{id}` is rejected unless another is lowered first.

State enums: `family_state` ∈ {incubating, active, archived}; `emissions_state` ∈ {incubating, active, saturated, archived, regression}; `visibility` ∈ {public, private}.

### Per-family runtime controls

Persisted per-family state lives in the DB table `challenge_family` (`family_state`, `emissions_state`, `emission_allocation`, `solve_threshold`, `solved_at`, `solved_score`) and is operated through:

- `GET /admin/families`: lists persisted states plus derived allocation shares.
- `POST /admin/families/{family_id}`: updates `family_state` / `emissions_state` / `emission_allocation` / `solve_threshold` (admin session required, at least one field, 400 otherwise). Setting `family_state='archived'` implicitly archives emissions unless an explicit `emissions_state` is given. `emission_allocation` and `solve_threshold` must be in [0.0, 1.0].

Allocation semantics are **absolute**: `allocation_share = emission_allocation × status_multiplier`, never normalized. All base weights are 1.0 except archived (0.0). If included shares sum past 1.0 a warning logs, miner weights scale down pro-rata, and the burn share drops to 0. A solved family keeps paying for `SOLVED_PAYOUT_DURATION` = 7 days after `solved_at`, then `archive_expired_solved_families` auto-archives its emissions and the family's slice burns from that point on.

## Validator Trust

Two independent layers, checked in this order on every validator request.

### 1. Signature + stake (`app/auth.py`)

Every validator request is signed by the hotkey over `timestamp:nonce:METHOD:path:body_sha256` (timestamp skew limit 60 s) and must carry on-chain stake ≥ `MIN_VALIDATOR_STAKE` (env, default **4096**) on `METAGRAPH_NETWORK` (default `finney`), netuid `METAGRAPH_NETUID` (default `124`). DB-cached stake counts as fresh for `DB_STAKE_FRESHNESS_SECONDS` (default 1800).

### 2. Coldkey whitelist: `TRUSTED_VALIDATOR_COLDKEYS`

Comma-separated coldkey whitelist, checked by `require_trusted_validator` on the 8 main evaluation endpoints in `api_validators.py` (task authorize, next-task, seed-scores, epoch publish, and friends).

| Whitelist state | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| Empty / unset | **Fail-closed**: every evaluation endpoint returns 403 and heartbeats tell validators to stop — nothing is evaluated until the whitelist is configured |
| Configured | **Fail-closed**: coldkey resolved from the DB (`validatoronchain`) then the metagraph; unresolved or unlisted coldkeys get 403 with "Contact the team to be added" |

`require_strict_trusted_validator` (private-track artifact bytes) applies the same fail-closed rule; the private track itself is dormant — every family is public.

> **Required before anything scores.** The whitelist gates all evaluation, so a fresh deploy must set `TRUSTED_VALIDATOR_COLDKEYS` before validators can take tasks. Set the whitelist **before** relying on evaluation.

---

## Version Gating & Cutover

Two version headers travel on every validator request, gated separately.

### Code version: `X-Code-Version`

Validators send `swarm.__version__` (currently `5.0.0`). The backend dependency `require_current_code_version` rejects with **HTTP 426** `validator_code_version_below_minimum` when the header is missing or below `MIN_VALIDATOR_CODE_VERSION` (env, default `5.0.0`). Private-track endpoints use `require_private_code_version` against `PRIVATE_MIN_VALIDATOR_CODE_VERSION` (env, default `5.0.0`). To cut old validators off after a release: bump these env vars and restart the backend. No code change needed.

### Benchmark version: `X-Benchmark-Version`

Validators send `BENCHMARK_VERSION` (the first 3 components of `swarm.__version__`). The backend fetches the official version from GitHub raw `swarm/__init__.py` on branch `SWARM_VERSION_REF` (env, default `main`), overridable wholesale via `SWARM_VERSION_URL`, cached 900 s. A submission counts as coming from an old validator only when its reported version parses **below** the official one: a *missing* header is accepted, not dropped. Old-validator seed scores are silently dropped (`recorded=0`).

When the official version changes, the version-transition job (checked every 5 minutes) expires all pending models to `VERSION_EXPIRED` and queues every champion for re-evaluation. This means **merging a version bump to `main` (or whatever `SWARM_VERSION_REF` points at) is the cutover trigger**: the backend picks it up in up to about 20 minutes (the 15-minute cache TTL plus the next 5-minute transition-job tick), without a deploy.

---

## The Screening Switch

`SCREENING_ENABLED = False` is a hardcoded module **constant** in `benchmark_logic.py`, not an env var. Flipping it means a code change plus a backend redeploy.

With screening off (the current and default behavior):

- Fresh submissions enter as `PENDING_BENCHMARK` and the benchmark phase covers seed indices [0, 1100) in one pass (`BENCHMARK_SEEDS_PER_RUN`, env default 1100).
- Screening-phase authorization always returns `(False, 'screening disabled')`.
- A stray `PENDING_SCREENING` head is healed in place to `PENDING_BENCHMARK` (audit event `screening_disabled_promotion`), so the queue head can never be pinned by a phase that doesn't run.

Flipping it to `True` gates new models on a screening pass first: seeds [0, 300) (`SCREENING_SEEDS_PER_RUN`, env default 300), pass bar = champion score + screening improvement floor, then the benchmark phase continues over [300, 1100).

**The flip is self-healing.** `apply_screening_mode_fixups` runs at every backend startup (lifespan, under `LOCK_BENCHMARK_SCORES`):

| Direction | Fixup |
|-----------|-------|
| Screening off | All `PENDING_SCREENING` models moved to `PENDING_BENCHMARK` |
| Screening on | `PENDING_BENCHMARK` models with `screening_score IS NULL` moved back to `PENDING_SCREENING` |

Both directions cancel stale-phase tasks/batches, keep already-recorded seed scores, and reconcile batches for both phases (audit event `screening_mode_fixup`). So the operational procedure is simply: change the constant, deploy, restart: the DB converges on its own.

---

## Epochs & Freeze

- Epoch anchor: **2026-03-30 16:00:00 UTC** (a Monday); duration 7 × 86400 s. `epoch = floor((now − anchor) / duration) + 1`, derived purely from wall clock (no state to manage). The same anchor/duration constants exist validator-side.
- `EPOCH_FREEZE_SECONDS = 5400` (1.5 h, hardcoded): `is_in_freeze_window()` is true in the last 5400 s of an epoch. Its only production caller is the **chain scanner**, which skips scanning new chain commitments during the freeze. Commitments made in the window are picked up after rollover. The same constant exists in `swarm/constants.py` but nothing in the validator consumes it.
- The epoch-transition job runs every 5 minutes; on rollover it carries all `PENDING_SCREENING`/`PENDING_BENCHMARK` models submitted before the new epoch into it (partial results are discarded and evaluation restarts on the fresh seed set, queue position kept) and queues every current champion for re-evaluation on the fresh seeds.
- Seeds: each validator generates its own 1100 seeds per epoch per family from OS entropy (`random.SystemRandom`), stored under `state/epoch_seeds/`, and publishes them to the backend only **after** the epoch ends (`POST /validators/epoch/publish`, trusted-validator gated).

## Quick Reference: Where to Act

| I want to… | Do this |
|------------|---------|
| Keep out validators on the old contract | Nothing to do — only `agent_rpc.v1` validators are ever authorized |
| Add/change a family or its policy | Edit `swarm/swarm/domain_model/benchmark_domain_model.schema.json`, run `python3 swarm/scripts/sync_family_registry.py --backend swarm-backend --website Swarm-Website`, commit all three copies |
| Change a family's state or emission share live | `POST /admin/families/{family_id}` |
| Allow validators to evaluate | Set `TRUSTED_VALIDATOR_COLDKEYS` (fail-closed; empty means nothing scores) |
| Cut off old validator code | Bump `MIN_VALIDATOR_CODE_VERSION` / `PRIVATE_MIN_VALIDATOR_CODE_VERSION`, restart backend |
| Trigger a benchmark-version cutover | Merge the `swarm/__init__.py` version bump to the `SWARM_VERSION_REF` branch: backend follows within up to about 20 minutes |
| Turn screening on/off | Flip `SCREENING_ENABLED` in `benchmark_logic.py`, deploy, restart: startup fixups migrate the queue |
